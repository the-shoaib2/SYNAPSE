The Synapse Documentation MCP Server allows you to search and retrieve information from the Synapse documentation directly within your agent conversations.

## Set up

### Configure Synapse

1. Create a folder called `.synapse/mcpServers` at the top level of your workspace
2. Add a file called `synapse-docs-mcp.yaml` to this folder
3. Write the following contents and save:

```yaml title=".synapse/mcpServers/synapse-docs-mcp.yaml"
name: Synapse Documentation MCP
version: 0.0.1
schema: v1
mcpServers:
  - uses: continuedev/synapse-docs-mcp
```

### Enable Agent Mode

MCP servers only work in agent mode. Make sure to switch to agent mode in Synapse before testing.

## Usage Examples

Once configured, you can use the MCP server to search Synapse documentation:

### Model Configuration Help

```
How do I add Claude 4 Sonnet as a model from Bedrock in Synapse?
```

### Context Providers

```
What context providers are available in Synapse?
```

### Customization

```
How do I add custom rules to my assistant in Synapse?
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Loading

1. **Check configuration**: Ensure your YAML configuration uses the correct `uses` field with `continuedev/synapse-docs-mcp`
2. **Check agent mode**: MCP servers only work in agent mode
3. **Restart Synapse**: Try restarting the Synapse extension

### No Search Results

1. **Verify connection**: The MCP server needs internet access to search the documentation
2. **Check query format**: Try rephrasing your search query
3. **Test with known topics**: Search for well-documented features like "model configuration"
